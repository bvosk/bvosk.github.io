[Nerves](http://nerves-project.org/) is a way to build embedded Linux systems using the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) programming language. It combines a bunch of things I'm interested in: Embedded Linux, Elixir, and [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/)!

## Embedded Linux

I've worked on a variety of embedded systems, but haven't touched embedded Linux. Embedded Linux is cool because it's a middle ground between bare-metal embedded software and full blown application software. I got a Raspberry Pi for Christmas and it's been gathering dust since then. That will be our target.

## Elixir

Elixir is a functional programming language.  It's a far cry from the imperative approach of the traditional C, the language I spend most of my time with. This sharp contrast is an opportunity to gain perspective. While the growing number of functional programming languages are far from mainstream, a variety of functional concepts have been adopted by more commonly used programming languages (like C++ and JavaScript).

## Erlang

Elixir inherits a lot of concepts from Erlang and runs atop on the same virtual machine (BEAM). Erlang is known for its ability to produce highly concurrent, robust systems. These concepts are of growing importance to the embedded systems world, and the software world at large. Erlang accomplishes this by handling concurrency itself instead of delegating those duties to an operating system. Distributed, fault tolerant systems are realized through Erlang's model for independent processes with isolated memory, asynchronous message passing, and error containment. If it sounds confusing, that's probably because I don't understand it all that well.

# What are we going to build with Nerves?

I haven't figured that out yet. Let me know if you have any ideas!
