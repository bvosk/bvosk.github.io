A few months ago I was tasked with giving a 10 minute presentation to some of my
coworkers to develop my presentation skills. It's a part of the leadership
training offered in the rotational program we're in. As the focus was
on presentation skills rather than subject matter, the choice of content was
completely up to me.

When I got to thinking about what I would present, the answer became
increasingly clear. I had been given 10 uninterrupted minutes of attention from
a complete social group of mine, and I wasn't going to let that go to waste.
This was an opportunity to make an impact! But what's the impact that I wanted 
to make?

## Solve a problem

Anyone who knows me well will tell you that I love to complain.
It's not the most desirable trait, but I've come to
accept that it's part of how my brain works. This skeptical tendency isn't
without its drawbacks, but at its best it's helpful in identifying
solutions to problems that others don't see or won't address. One such problem
has resurfaced over and over again in all my social circles; exchanging cash.

Part of what makes this problem so particularly annoying is that good solutions
already exist to address it. Apps like Square and Venmo are somewhat
popular, but my social groups have yet to commit to one
solution with any deliberation. This was my chance to do something about
that! So when I thought of what to talk about during my 10 minutes on stage, this
problem quickly became the frontrunner.

## Slides

Below you will find the slides that I presented to my colleagues/friends. 
I am sharing this in the hopes that you find it useful in convincing your social
group to commit to one digital payment system. I know not everyone will have my
unique opportunity to present with a visual aid, but I think the structure of
the proposal was effective. With tongue in cheek, this is my ["tiny ripple of hope"](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/705426-each-time-a-man-stands-up-for-an-ideal-or) 
Here's how it helps you make your case:

- Provides an example of the problem in action using a split restaurant bill
- Summarizes what a digital payment system is
- Lists pros and cons
- Relates the network effect to this problem
- Lists popular options
- Urges the group to form a consensus and commit to one digital payment system

## Tips for success

Here are some tips that I've gathered during my ongoing crusade:

###  Make the case for digital payment systems, not one in particular

Don't let the details of which application to use foil the progress of
switching to _any_ digital payment system. Going from cash to a suboptimal
digital payment system is way better than never making the switch because you
got stonewalled by someone who wasn't hooked on your particular preference.

### Address legitimate concerns directly

I have found that the most popular reasons for not using a digital payment
system is laziness and a lack of group coordination, but some have legitimate reasons
for being apprehensive. Talk through these concerns, don't shy away from them.

### Don't take credit

As some of your friends take the plunge into digital payment systems, you may
feel an urge to celebrate your success. You can party in your thoughts, but
don't do it publicly. Celebrate the group's new enlightened users and make sure
they're enjoying this newfound convenience.

### Be persistent

It's difficult to find a balance between persistence and annoyance, but this
won't happen in a day. Keep up the good work!


Good luck. With a little hope, we can sweep down the mightiest walls of cash and
enjoy the bright future of digital payments sooner rather than later!
