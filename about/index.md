## Welcome!
Hi, I'm Brian. I'm an embedded systems engineer in upstate New York. This is my personal blog. It's geared toward embedded systems software, but everything is fair game here.

## Software trends that interest me:
* Design patterns in embedded systems
* Test-driven development
* Exciting new programming languages like [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* Build automation tools like [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) and [Cargo](https://crates.io/)

## Other things you may find here:
* Thoughts on current events
* Content I find worthy of sharing
* Rants that quickly spiral out of control

## Still have questions?
